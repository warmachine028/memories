# Memories setup guidelines üöÄ

**Hello contributor, I want you to stick to the below listed Setup guidelines to successfully setup the react app in your local system and get started with developing!!**

<br/>

-   Check if your branch is behind the original branch.
-   Always update the branch with original branch `memories:main` before starting any new developement.
-   `Fork` the repo to your account.
-   Open Git bash in a folder.
-   Enter this command to clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/[your-github-id]/memories.git`
-   Now you have the repo in your **local storage**
-   Open the project in VSCode or any Code Editor of your choice.
-   Go inside `client` folder by using `cd client`.
-   Next to setup the react app `npm i` in the terminal inside your project directory.
-   Set Up Environment Variables, take reference from **[ENV_VARIABLES](./ENV_VARIABLES.md)** file.
-   Once the node modules and other stuffs are installed , `npm run dev` to start the app in `http://localhost:3000/`
-   You can acess the `server` folder to get the backend and start it with `npm start` in `http://localhost:5000/`
    -   Currently since the server is already deployed, hence it uses the deployed server by default.
    -   If you make changes in server files, then navigate to `client/src/api/`
    -   Open `index.jsx` file.
    -   Change the index of the array from `const API = axios.create({ baseURL: apiURL[0] })` to `...apiURL[1]...`
    -   This will make the app use the locally running server
-   Make changes **according** to the Tasks assigned to you
-   Maintain the folder structure , keep small components like **Navbar, Home** in `src\components` folder
-   We have used **Material UI & Styled Components** for styling, Styling files are available in `[component]\styles.js`.
-   You are also allowed to use GOOGLE FONTS for same fonts as of figma files.
-   Other extra **Pictures, icons , svgs** are to be kept in `src\images\`
-   Once you are done with the changes , `cd ..` to come to the root folder
-   Once all server related changes are done locally
    -   Reset the index of the array from `const API = axios.create({ baseURL: apiURL[1] })` to `...apiURL[0]...` to reuse the deployed server
-   `git pull` to pull the latest version of the code
-   `git add .` to stage for commits
-   `git commit -am "message"` for commiting the code.
-   **REMEMBER** --> YOU NEED TO PULL REQ ON `main` BRANCH !!
-   Once done create a Pull Request and wait for the repo-owner to review.
-   Attach proper **`Screenshots, Proper Description and Issue Number` in the Pull request**
-   Dont forget to ‚≠ê the repository on github <br/>
